### What is Celsius scale?

Celsius, also called centigrade, scale based on 0° for the freezing point of water and 100° for the boiling point of water. 

### What is Fahrenheit scale?

Fahrenheit temperature scale, scale based on 32° for the freezing point of water and 212° for the boiling point of water, the interval between the two being divided into 180 equal parts.

### What is Kelvin scale?

It is the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units that is defined by setting the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant to be 1.380649 x 10–23 joules per kelvin and that is equal to 1/273.16 of the Kelvin scale temperature of the triple point of water.

### Formulae for Conversion

#### 1. Formula to Convert Temperature in Celsius to Temperature in Fahrenheit

$$ °F = °C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 $$

#### 2. Formula to Convert Temperature in Fahrenheit to Temperature in Celsius

$$ °C = (°F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}  $$

#### 3. Formula to Convert Temperature in Celsius to Temperature in Kelvin

$$ K = °C + 273.15  $$

#### 4. Formula to Convert Temperature in Kelvin to Temperature in Celsius

$$ °C = K - 273.15  $$
